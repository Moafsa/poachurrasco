# Security Guidelines - POA Churrasco

## üîí Security Best Practices

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the POA Churrasco project and provides guidelines for maintaining security.

## üõ°Ô∏è Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Environment Variables
- All sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens) are stored in environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials in the codebase
- `.env` file is properly excluded from version control

### 2. API Key Management
- Google Places API key
- Google Maps API key
- Google OAuth credentials
- OpenAI API key
- ElevenLabs API key
- Foursquare API key (optional)

### 3. Database Security
- PostgreSQL with secure password configuration
- Database credentials stored in environment variables
- No sensitive data in database migrations

### 4. Docker Security
- Non-root user in containers
- Proper file permissions
- Network isolation between services

## üîê Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` with the following variables:

```env
# Application
APP_KEY=your-app-key-here
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Database
DB_PASSWORD=your-secure-database-password-here

# Google Services
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id-here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret-here
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your-google-places-api-key-here
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key-here

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# ElevenLabs
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-elevenlabs-api-key-here
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=your-voice-id-here

# Optional Services
FOURSQUARE_API_KEY=your-foursquare-api-key-here
SLACK_BOT_USER_OAUTH_TOKEN=your-slack-token-here
```

## üö® Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All API keys are properly configured in environment variables
- [ ] Database password is strong and unique
- [ ] Google API keys have proper restrictions configured
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled for production
- [ ] File permissions are properly set
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Regular security updates applied

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Log Monitoring
- Monitor `storage/logs/laravel.log` for security-related errors
- Check for failed authentication attempts
- Monitor API usage and rate limiting

### API Security
- Google Places API: Monitor usage and implement rate limiting
- OpenAI API: Monitor token usage and costs
- ElevenLabs API: Monitor audio generation usage

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Update Dependencies**: Keep all packages updated
   ```bash
   composer update
   npm update
   ```

2. **Review API Keys**: Regularly rotate API keys
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check for suspicious activity
4. **Backup Security**: Ensure secure backup procedures

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Compromised API Key**: Immediately revoke and regenerate
2. **Data Breach**: Follow incident response procedures
3. **Security Updates**: Apply critical updates immediately
